    <h2>How Inner Joiner Works</h2>
    <p>With the inner join command in SQL, it selects records for two matching values in two separate tables. When using it, you first identify the two tables and select the column names. Following that, you say "From" the first table you would like to "Inner Join" the second. And, finally, you identify the matching values between the tables and say "On" the account where table1.thecolumnwithmatchingvalues = table2.thecolumnwithmatchingvalues</p>
    
    <p>Say a person was trying to inner join a table that had house prices and one with the realtors, and the column that the two share in common is the address of the house. The SQL for such might look like <br /> <br /> <b>SELECT</b> Housing.HousePrice, Realtors.RealtorName <br /> <br /> <b>FROM</b> Housing <br /> <br /> <b>INNER JOIN</b> Realtors <br /><br /> <b>ON</b>  Realtors.HouseAddress=Housing.HouseAddress;</p>
    
    <h2>What is a Data Scientist VS Computer Scientist</h2>
    <p>Data scientists are people who make new discoveries about large sets of data. They may make hypothesis about what they might expect to extract from the data, but they ultimately let data speak for itself. While a programmer is focused on the technical skill, a data scientist takes that piece and combines that with the understanding of the business world. Furthermore, a computer scientist's work is more tangible than that of a data scientist, as they often develop theories from the data that they analyze. An example of such might be the discovery of the optimal time to purchase a plane ticket based off of analyzing ticket sales over the last 12 months from many airlines.  They use a combination of computer science and mathematical knowledge in order to provide new insights within a data set and create algorithims that analyze and interpret data that would not have any meaning otherwise. </p>
